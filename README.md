# LangtonsAnt
A Java and LibGDX implementation of Langton's Ant (WIP)

Langton's ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. 
It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells.

This repository is home to my attempt at a Java implementation of Langton's ant, made as a project for fun.

After basic functionality, I hope to add a bit more onto the program, such as the ability to set up the
initial arrangement of tiles.

I'm not terribly familiar with LibGDX currently, nor am I accomplished in being entirely efficient in my code 100%
of the time, so forgive me for shortcomings in my code.

P.S. I've tried cloning this repository into other IDEs configured the same as the one I use, but the program behaves
extremely strange and does not function. Sorry.
